This release includes:

## What's Changed

### Enhancements

Breaking changes
* `k6deps` library no longer searches for the manifest file. It must be specified explicitly in the `Options.Manifest.Name`
* `k6deps` CLI only searches for a manifest in the same directory as the script (unless `--ignore-manifest` option is specified)
* All files analyzed by `k6deps` (including all files imported) must be under the working directory. By default it is the current directory. Use the `Options.Dir` option in the library or `--work-dir` CLI option to change this location.
